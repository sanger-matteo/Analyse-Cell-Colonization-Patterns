# Analyse-Cell-Colonization-Patterns
Quantify the colonization behaviours of different bacterial strains


The Exp_X# folders contain the network as it develop over time. Simply use ImageJ to create a slow movie or show the frames you like. The “A” are wildtype and “B” are Dpch

 	


The “Exp_B2_DensityAllTimePoints_50um” simply take all the time points and place all cell points in a single “map”. I can then plot is it as a density plot. This show that the wt cells positions are not highly conserved within the movie, therefore we have low diffuse values everywhere. On the other hand the Dpch has a few focal spot where cells are constantly concentrated.

 		 

It looks quite cool, like some results of star analysis. The color-scale value (in (num. cells)/(2500 um2)) goes from as follow: 0 at black---violet---red---yellow---white---20 

The Line plots show the “distributions of distances in the Delanunay network”, for all frames. The color coding tells you the time: (t=0)---Black---red---yellow---(t=10)


This repository contains the scripts used to creates results and plots concerning colonization behaviour for the paper:
